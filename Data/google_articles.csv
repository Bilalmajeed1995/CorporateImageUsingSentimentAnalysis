The biggest question is how much of a cut GameStop is getting.
Neither of the two investors that Ars Technica sourced have any concrete answers; GameStop has not yet responded to a request for comment.

But the legislation, called the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, has become the target of multinational companies including Apple whose supply chains touch the far western Xinjiang region, as well as of business groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.
Lobbyists have fought to water down some of its provisions, arguing that while they strongly condemn forced labor and current atrocities in Xinjiang, the act’s ambitious requirements could wreak havoc on supply chains that are deeply embedded in China.
Xinjiang produces vast amounts of raw materials like cotton, coal, sugar, tomatoes and polysilicon, and supplies workers for China’s apparel and footwear factories.

Last year, Adidas produced more than 11 million pairs of shoes with plastic waste and has goals to produce “a record 15 to 20 million pairs of shoes with plastic waste” this year.

The National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) attributed the failure to “the rapid growth of steel, building materials, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and the service sector”.
China aims to cut energy intensity by 15% from 2015-2020, but experts said it might struggle to meet the target as it concentrates on more energy-intensive projects in the second half of 2020.

The offshore wind power law is supposed to streamline and speed up administrative procedures in order to enable a swift implementation of licensed offshore wind projects and also sets the legal basis for green hydrogen production at sea, the ministry said.
""This would further reduce the number of actors in the offshore wind sector,"" Liebing said, adding that the amendment would likely pose a hurdle to municipal utilities seeking to engage in offshore wind projects, rather than making these more accessible.
Environmental organisation NABU criticised the ""hasty"" decision to raise the expansion target, saying it ignores the need to reconcile renewable power production with animal protection.

The approach could help Trump bolster support in the large Cuban-American community in Florida, a state considered vital to his re-election chances in November.

The Complaint notes that Bell and Rogers' wholesale rate manipulation resulted in higher retail prices for Internet services in Canada's largest markets – costing millions of Canadians hundreds of millions of dollars.
Over 150,000 Canadians have voiced their support for the CRTC's decision and urged the federal cabinet to support lower Internet and cell phone bills.
With offices in Chatham, Ontario and Gatineau, Quebec, TekSavvy is Canada's largest independent telecom service company with over 300,000 customers from coast to coast.
