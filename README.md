# CorporateImageUsingSentimentAnalysis

## 1.1 Background and Problem Statement
The availability of ratings and reviews, and presence on social media and other platforms may be helpful in determining a company’s success. The opinions of consumers from these different bodies of textual data are useful sources of sentiment. Especially with the recent pandemic, these opinions might have an impact on the overall corporate sentiment. Therefore, using the available data, an analysis was conducted to first determine the corporate sentiment from each available source, then the extracted sentiments were combined to generate an overall corporate sentiment. Once the overall corporate sentiment was generated, the correlation with popularity in terms of search volume and two financial performance indicators were used to measure effectiveness of the individual or combination of sentiments by answering the questions: Does the calculated corporate sentiment score impact a corporation’s popularity and financial performance?
